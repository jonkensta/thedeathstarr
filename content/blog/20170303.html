A man's hubris:
I believe its important to have a medium for self-expression and introspection.
As a result, I'm making another attempt to roll a blog.
This time around, I'm leveraging my experience with Python and <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/">Jinja2</a> and using a templating system called <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a>.

{%- endmark %}


I briefly considered going the over-engineered route and using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org"/>Flask</a> with a database, but
statically serving up HTML is obviously much simpler with many fewer moving parts.
Maybe as I'm getting older I am realizing that it's better to be a little under-powered and preserve some simplicity and elegance in your solution.


Overall, my experience with <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a> has been a little mixed.
As given from its name,
it's a Python clone of the ruby-based <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> templating system.
From what I can remember of Jekyll, however,
Hyde feels a little clunky in comparison:
It doesn't appear to be able to handle markdown, and
the configuration system seems a little haphazard.
But Hyde is written in Python and allows me to be able to use Jinja2, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.


For the layout, I'm currently using <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> CSS framework.
I considered using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> as I have for other projects,
but Skeleton is much simpler and is sufficient for my purposes [see above].
I wanted my blog to be super minimalist this time around and getting Bootstrap there would have taken quite a lot of tweaks.
It also doesn't help that all my Bootstrap sites look all fundamentally the same (nice in a respect but kind of boring).


I feel as though I have finally reached the point in my life where I have developed my self-discpline enough to follow through on some cool projects,
and I hope that this blog is one of them.
The last few years have gone by so fast, and sometimes it's hard to remember exactly what has happened.
As such,
it's worthwhile for me to spend some time going through and documenting the various thoughts that I have had and projects that I have undertaken.
